# Tutorial: Chrome-extension-Manifest-V3-

This project is a **Chrome extension** that acts as a *tracker blocker*. It silently **prevents known trackers** from loading on websites you visit, enhancing your privacy. The extension also displays a *real-time count* of blocked trackers right on its browser icon, changing color to give you a quick visual summary of the page's tracking activity.
